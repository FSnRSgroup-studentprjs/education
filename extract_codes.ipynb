    "#### Not Applicable and Missing Values and Other Special Codes\n",
    " In DHS datasets there are several special values that have particular codes.  Two of them are very important – not applicable and missing.  The DHS Program treats these two differently although some software treat them as the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Not applicable” is defined as when a question is not supposed to be asked due to the flow of the questionnaire.  For example question 227 in the Woman’s Questionnaire “How many months pregnant are you?” is not applicable if the answer to the preceding question 226 “Are you pregnant now?” is No or Unsure. Question 227 would be left blank in the questionnaire in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Missing” is defined as a variable that should have a response, but because of interview error the question was not asked. For example, question 227 “How many months pregnant are you?” should be answered if a woman responded Yes to question 226 “Are you pregnant now?”  If the interviewer incorrectly left the question blank then a code is required to recognize that. The general rule for DHS data processing is that answers should not be made up, and so a “missing value” will be assigned. The data will be kept as missing in the data file and no imputation for this kind of question will be done. Missing values in general are codes 9, 99, 999, 9999, etc. depending on the number of digits used for the variable.\n",
    "\n",
